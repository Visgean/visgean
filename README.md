### Ahoj!

Hi, **I am Martin**, but I go by **[Visgean](https://visgean.me) on the internet**. In my spare time I develop small goofy utilities to experiment with new languages and frameworks. You can see them here on Github. Most recently I made [qr-wifi](https://github.com/Visgean/qr-wifi) - a Go utility to share wifi passwords in QR codes âœ¨. I also take photos which you can see [here](https://tintinburgh.com/) ðŸ“·. 

I work for [Dexter energy](https://dexterenergy.ai/), an energy forecasting company in Amsterdam. I am happy working there so I am **not open to any offers at the moment**. 

More about me at [https://visgean.me](https://visgean.me).
