# Hello internet travellers!

Hi, **I am Martin**, but I go by **[Visgean](https://visgean.me) on the internet**. I create small goofy tools to experiment with new languages and frameworks. You can see them here on Github.

I work for [Dexter energy](https://dexterenergy.ai/), an energy forecasting company in Amsterdam. More about me at [https://visgean.me](https://visgean.me). I also take photos which you can see [here](https://tintinburgh.com/).
